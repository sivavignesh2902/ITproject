Intensely curious and driven to explore, the student community of Ezee Education value rigorous analytical thinking, ingenuity, hands-on problem solving, and big new ideas.
                The departments and centres of the Institute are responsible for the academic activities which include Teaching, Research and Industrial Consultancy.
                The courses of study are organized as semester programs and each semester provides for a minimum of seventy instructional days. The medium of instruction is English. Students are evaluated on a continuous basis throughout the semester. Evaluation is done by the faculty, a consequence of the autonomous status granted to the Institute.

            <img src="../images/main2.jpg" alt="ABC" />
            <p>
                It all began in 1956, when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, was on an official visit to West Germany and was offered assistance by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, to set up a higher technological institute in India. This resulted in the signing of the first Indo-German Agreement in Bonn in 1959, for the establishment of an Ezee Educations. The first Indo-German Agreement provided for the services of German professors and five foremen, training facilities for 20 Indian faculty members and the supply of scientific and technical equipment for the establishment of the Central Workshop and 20 laboratories at Ezee Educations
